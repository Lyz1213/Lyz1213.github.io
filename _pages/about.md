## About me
I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University under the supervision of Prof. [Yang Liu](https://personal.ntu.edu.sg/yangliu/). Prior to this, I got my master's degree from the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh supervised by Prof. [Alan Bundy](https://sweb.inf.ed.ac.uk/bundy/) and Kobby Nuamah, and my bachelor's degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the School of Computer Science and Engineering at Nanyang Technological University under the supervision of Prof. Yang Liu. Prior to this, I got my master's degree from the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh supervised by Alan Bundy and Kobby Nuamah, and my bachelor's degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications.

My research interest lies in Natural Language Processing, Large Language Models, and their applications in code for code intelligence.
